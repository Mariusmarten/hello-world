I'm a 3th year undergraduate student currently studying at Maastricht University in Psychology majoring in Neuroscience. Planning on graduating in the summer of 2019. Looking for a Master in Artificial Intelligence / System Biology afterwards. 

I'm passionate about applying my knowledge of computer science and machine learning in neuroscience and advancing my knowledge of complex systems, chaotic behavior and deep simplicity.


### Education
* **Example** (June 2016 - September 2016)

* **Example** (June 2016 - September 2016)
  - Developed object localization algorithms through convolutional neural networks for deployment on IBM's TrueNorth neuromorphic chip. 
  - Wrote Matlab functions and shell scripts to format and preprocess datasets.
  - Implemented a selective search and sliding window based approach to localization.
  - Trained a convolutional neural network to place bounding boxes over a specific object of interest with a classification accuracy of 92.86%.
  - Presented results to a group of engineers and upper level management at the conclusion of the internship.
* **Research at Mainz University** (June 2014 - August 2014)
