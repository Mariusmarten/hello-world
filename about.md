I'm a 3th year undergraduate student currently studying at Maastricht University in Psychology majoring in Neuroscience. Planning on graduating in the summer of 2019. Looking for a Master in Artificial Intelligence / System Biology afterwards. 

‚I wanna believe as many true things and has few false things as possible.‘

I'm passionate about applying my knowledge of computer science and machine learning in neuroscience and advancing my knowledge of complex systems, chaotic behavior and deep simplicity.
