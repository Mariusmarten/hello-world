Maastricht, 2018: Flow & Memory
====================
Investiagting the possible relationship between a state of 'being in the flow' and memory recosolidation. 

The positive psychology concept flow is defined as the rewarding experience of being fully immersed in a task. In order to reach flow state, a balance of challenge and skills, explicit feedback, indistinct sense of time, positive affect and intrinsic motivation are crucial. This study investigated physiological correlates of flow, as well as the effect of flow on memory performance. Two different tasks were used: a smartphone game called Piano Tiles, and a modified Orientation Discrimination Task (ODT). It was hypothesized (1) that flow and heart rate variability (HRV) are negatively associated and (2) that flow and memory recognition rates in the modified ODT are positively associated. In order to investigate these hypotheses, participants completed three sessions: ODT training, ODT while recording HRV, and Piano Tiles while recording HRV. It was found that both tasks were flow-inducing. Moreover, higher subjective flow ratings were associated with increases in HRV, contradicting previous findings. Furthermore, contrary to expectations, overall memory recognition was highest when items were presented in a less-flow state. This study may have important implications for developers of educational games, who can use these insights, in order to improve memory performance and thereby also learning performance.
