A collection of resources for Machine Learning, Computational Neuroscience and Complex Systems, I find useful or interesting.

### Computational Neuroscience

- 

### Machine Learning
- MacKays, [Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms](https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf) and his [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruBu5BI5n4aFpG32iMbdWoRVAA-Vcso6)
- Bishops, [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)
- Murphy’s, [Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective](https://doc.lagout.org/science/Artificial%20Intelligence/Machine%20learning/Machine%20Learning_%20A%20Probabilistic%20Perspective%20%5BMurphy%202012-08-24%5D.pdf)
